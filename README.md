# Tech Sky Hacker Lab

## Purpose
This is a demo website created to simulate a hacker-style login page with a cool neon binary rain background.  
The goal is to experiment with web effects and showcase ethical hacking design aesthetics.

## How to Access
You can view and test the live site here:  
[https://rootoser002-code.github.io/hacker-site/](https://rootoser002-code.github.io/hacker-site/)

## Usage 
- The site works in all modern browsers.
- You can use this site to practise and learn phishing stimulation / credential stealing 
- Try logging in with the username `root` and password `toor` to see an "ACCESS GRANTED" message.
- Any other login will display "ACCESS DENIED".
- - This is purely for visual/demo purposes â€” no real authentication occurs.
